How to Use the Dashboard

Open the Excel file bike_sales_dashboard.xlsx.

Use the slicers/buttons on the left to filter the data dynamically:

Select Marital Status, Region, or Education to filter charts.

Analyze the charts:

Customer Age Brackets – See bike purchases across age groups.

Customer Commute – Analyze how distance traveled impacts bike purchase decisions.

Combine multiple filters to explore deeper insights.
